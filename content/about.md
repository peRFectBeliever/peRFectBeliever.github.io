**Buddies!! Welcome to my blog 🍿**

Here, I rant about tech like [Sheldon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper) explains string theory in _[The Big Bang Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)_, drop Tamil poems with more drama than [Tyrion’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister) speeches in _[Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones)_, and share opinions on cinema and world affairs—sometimes deep, sometimes more random than [Joey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Tribbiani) asking “How you doin’?” in _[Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends)_.

**A little snippet about me:**  
I’m a village boy who got into IT for money (yup, classic _[Walter White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_%28Breaking_Bad%29)_ origin story 🧪). But somewhere between deadlines and deployments, I actually fell in love with it.  
Then I found a girl I love even more ( _[Mundinam Parthene moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93iK4wNij8E)_ ❤️), and now we’ve got a kid who basically runs our house like Kevin McCallister in _[Home Alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Alone)_—setting up chaos, traps, and laughter all in one go.

I may seem tough to start a discussion with, but once you get to know me, I’m like _[Shashi Tharoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashi_Tharoor)_ —sarcastic, wordy, and occasionally wise.
