# What is Docker Container:
A container is a standard unit of software that **packages up code and all its dependencies** so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a **lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings**.
