Becoming a **Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)** requires a blended skill set of both a developer and a quality assurance professional. For a Java-focused SDET, a solid understanding of programming concepts, test automation frameworks, and the software development lifecycle is crucial. Here is a study checklist to help you get started:

## Core Java Concepts ‚òïÔ∏è

-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Master the four pillars: **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **abstraction**, and **polymorphism**. Understand classes, objects, constructors, and the differences between an abstract class and an interface.
Detailed Guide [here](./OOPS_basics.md)

    
-   **Data Structures and Collections:** Be proficient in using Java's Collections Framework. Know the differences and use cases for `List` (e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`), `Set` (e.g., `HashSet`, `TreeSet`), and `Map` (e.g., `HashMap`, `TreeMap`). Understand when to use which and be familiar with their internal workings and time complexities.
    
-   **Control Flow & Syntax:** Solidify your understanding of basic Java syntax, including variables, data types, operators, conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`), and loops (`for`, `while`).
    
-   **Exception Handling:** Know how to use `try-catch-finally` blocks to handle runtime errors and maintain the normal flow of an application.
    
-   **Multithreading:** Learn about the thread lifecycle, synchronization, and the `Executor` framework. This is important for handling parallel test execution.
    
-   **String Manipulation:** Practice common string operations using the `String` class and `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for efficiency.

## Test Automation Frameworks & Tools üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Selenium WebDriver:** This is a fundamental tool for web automation. Learn how to set up the WebDriver, locate elements using various locators (`id`, `name`, `xpath`, `cssSelector`), and perform user actions like clicking and typing. Understand how to use explicit and implicit waits to handle dynamic web elements.
    
-   **Unit Testing Frameworks:** Master either **TestNG** or **JUnit** (or both). These frameworks are used to create structured test cases and provide features like annotations (`@Test`, `@BeforeMethod`), assertions, and test reporting.
    
-   **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Gain experience with a BDD framework like **Cucumber**. Learn how to write human-readable test cases in Gherkin syntax (`Given`, `When`, `Then`) and link them to your Java code.
    
-   **API Testing:** Learn to test APIs using libraries like **REST Assured**. Understand HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`), status codes, and how to validate API responses.
    
-   **Build Tools:** Become familiar with **Maven** or **Gradle**. These tools help manage project dependencies and build automation.
    
-   **CI/CD Tools:** Get hands-on experience with continuous integration/continuous delivery tools like **Jenkins**. Learn how to integrate your automated test suite into a CI/CD pipeline to enable continuous testing.
    
-   **Version Control:** Be proficient with **Git** for source code management. Learn commands for basic operations like `commit`, `push`, `pull`, and `merge` as well as branching strategies.

## SDET-Specific Skills üß†

-   **Testing Methodologies:** Understand different testing levels (unit, integration, end-to-end), software development models (Agile, Scrum), and testing types (functional, regression, performance, security).
    
-   **Problem-Solving & Algorithms:** Practice solving coding problems on platforms like LeetCode. This strengthens your algorithmic thinking and helps you write efficient code for your test automation.
    
-   **Database Testing:** Learn basic SQL queries to verify data integrity and conduct database testing.
    
-   **Soft Skills:** Communication, collaboration, and a keen eye for detail are essential for an SDET.
